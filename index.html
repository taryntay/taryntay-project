	<h2>Cavalier King Charles Spaniels</h2>
	<p>Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, or "Cavaliers" for short, are the smallest of the spaniel breeds. With Cavaliers, you get the best of both worlds. They love the outdoors because of their sporting background, but are also content to curl up on your lap.</p>

<div id="history">
	<a id="HistoryLink"><h3>History</h3></a>
	<p>Today's Cavalier King Charles Spaniels have come from centuries of breeding. Small spaniels were beloved by British royalty, and can even be seen in paintings and portraits as early as the 16th century.</p>
	
	<p>In the 1800's, spaniels with longer noses began to disappear as short snouted breeds became more popular. The modern day Cavalier almost became extinct, but in 1926, Roswell Eldridge began to revive the original look of the breed. The first Cavalier club was formed in 1928, and the breed was finally recognized by the American Kennel Club in <span>1997</span>. Today, the Cavalier ranks #21 on the most registered dog breed in the US.</p>

<section id="health">
	<a id="HealthLink"><h3>Health Problems to Watch For</h3></a>
	<p>Because of the way the Cavalier was bred in the early to mid 1900's, they tend to suffer more health problems than other breeds. Fortunately, breeders are now using genetics and modern science to weed out these disorders, but they are still prevalent and Cavaliers <em>need</em> to have vet checks <strong>twice a year</strong> to prevent complications. These are the most common disorders, in order of their prevalence:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Mitral Valve Disease</li>
		<li>Syringomyelia</li>
		<li>Hip Dysplasia</li>
		<li>Luxating Patella</li>
	</ol>

	<a id="BlogLink"><h3>Blog Post: Finding A Reputable Breeder</h3></a>
	<p id="date">March 29, 2012 11:05am</p>
	<p>If you are looking to add a Cavalier to your home, I cannot stress enough how important it is to do your research. My first recommendation would be to adopt a Cavalier from a rescue like Cavalier Rescue USA. There are many Cavaliers who need homes, and this is a good place to start. If, however, you are looking to raise a puppy, or adopting is just out of the picture, you must look for reputable breeders.</p>
	<p>Cavaliers are sadly prone to many health problems and "backyard breeders", or breeders who just breed to make money, should not be supported. They do not perform the necessary health screenings or comply to any standards of how to breed Cavaliers safely. They are only in it for profit.</p>
	<p> Even worse than the backyard breeder is the pet store. <strong>Never</strong> purchase a living animal from a pet store. Most of these dogs come from puppy mills, where conditions and treatment are absolutely terrible. They do not care about the well being of the breed. Instead, please search for reputable breeders. Cavalier clubs are a great place to start. Reputable breeders perform health checks, have nice facilities that they will be more than happy to show to you, and genuinely care about the breed. Most likely, they will be questioning you to be sure you are a good candidate for one of their puppies. This is a very good sign. You may have to wait 6 months to a year to get your puppy because many of these breeders have waiting lists, but it is well worth it!</p>
